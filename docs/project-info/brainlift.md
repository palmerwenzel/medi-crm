# MediCRM Brainlift

## Purpose
- MediCRM is a modern Patient Relationship Management platform designed for healthcare environments, supporting clinics, hospitals, and telehealth providers.
- We employ generative AI (chatbots, triage helpers) to handle patient inquiries, reduce staff workload, and ensure that human intervention happens only when necessary.
- This Brainlift exists to:
  - Guide architectural and feature decisions, especially those related to AI-driven case handling and patient self-service.
  - Maintain an AI-first philosophy centered on rapid, intelligent responses and seamless communication.
  - Document MediCRM’s unique approach to real-time healthcare support, case management, and secure patient interactions.
  - Track knowledge specific to healthcare regulations, compliance, merging EHR data, and scaling for large patient/staff volumes.

## SpikyPOVs

### Truths
- Managing patient inquiries effectively requires a robust case (ticket) system, with dynamic metadata, real-time staff collaboration, and role-based permissions.  
- Generative AI chatbots and triage helpers should be highly visible to channel routine questions away from staff.  
- Priority and tracking tools are critical for urgent medical cases; automated assignment based on specialty or schedules can save time.  
- Detailed audit logs, secure data storage, and healthcare regulations compliance (HIPAA-like considerations) are central to MediCRM.  
- Performance across communication channels—live chat, patient portal, or email—must remain swift and responsive.  
- Flexibility in data modeling (attachments, insurance details, advanced stages of triage) keeps MediCRM adaptable to each facility’s needs.

### Myths
- We do not believe in treating AI as a “nice-to-have”; it is a core feature for reducing clinical burden.  
- We do not believe staff dashboards should be cluttered; carefully structured queues, filters, and quick actions foster efficient patient care.  
- We do not believe that advanced systems must sacrifice performance or clarity; thoughtful Next.js + Supabase integration maintains both.  
- We do not believe in limiting patients to a single channel; MediCRM must be omnichannel (web portal, chatbots, real-time staff messaging).
