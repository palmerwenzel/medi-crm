## 7. Hosting & Deployment
**Vercel**  
• Optimized for Next.js, automatic deployment of branches/previews  
• Edge functions for serverless execution  

---

## 8. AI/LLM Integration
**OpenAI API**  
• Straightforward REST endpoints, good resource libraries for Node.js  
• Wide range of model options (ChatGPT, GPT-4, embeddings)  

---

## 9. Testing & QA
**Jest**  
• Widely supported, good TypeScript integration  
• Works well with React Testing Library for component testing
