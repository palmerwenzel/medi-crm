# TonIQ: AI-Powered Patient Relationship Management

## Background

Healthcare CRM solutions are essential to medical facilities, telehealth providers, clinics, and private practices. They help teams manage patient interactions, integrate with electronic health record (EHR) systems, and ensure compliance with healthcare regulations.

Medical CRMs often guide patients to self-service medical FAQs and resources before allowing direct provider interactions. However, many inquiries still require human intervention, which can be resource-intensive. TonIQ aims to leverage generative AI to minimize workload, enhance the patient experience, and streamline case handling. By integrating existing healthcare resources with LLM-driven assistance, TonIQ delivers a highly effective—they can still escalate to human care when necessary, but the default workflows can handle most cases efficiently, boosting productivity and reducing overall costs.

## Submission Guidelines

At the end of each week, you’ll need to submit the following to the GauntletAI LMS:

- A link to your project’s GitHub repository.  
- The Brainlifts you used to learn about and enhance the application.  
- A 5-minute walkthrough showcasing what you’ve built (and, where relevant, how you built it).  
- A link to your project post on X, along with evidence of engagement with any feedback received.  

## Baseline App (Week 1)

### Building a Modern Patient Support System

Creating a modern healthcare support system requires careful attention to clinical workflows, patient experience, and internal team collaboration. This document outlines the core functionalities required for a functional, scalable, and patient-centric solution. Your goal is to rebuild as many of the following components as possible.

### Core Architecture

#### Case (Ticket) Data Model
The case system is central to TonIQ, capturing the full care journey for each patient inquiry. Key components include:

- Standard Identifiers & Timestamps: Basic fields like case ID, creation date, and status updates.  
- Flexible Metadata:  
  - Dynamic Status Tracking: Reflect different stages of clinical workflows ( triage, awaiting test results, final follow-up, etc.).  
  - Priority Levels: Ensure prompt responses for urgent medical issues.  
  - Custom Fields: Adapt to specific medical facility needs.  
  - Tags: Categorize inquiries (e.g., pediatrics, cardiology, mental health).  
  - Internal Notes: Enable secure medical staff collaboration.  
  - Full Conversation History: Document all patient–provider interactions comprehensively.

### API-Minded Design

An API-minded approach ensures broader accessibility and interoperability, enabling:

- Integration: Connect with EHR systems, scheduling platforms, and other healthcare tools.  
- Automation: Reduce administrative tasks, such as auto-assigning cases based on specialty.  
- AI Enhancements: Provide a foundation for future expansions (auto-triage, symptom analysis).  
- Analytics: Track performance metrics like response times and patient outcomes.

### API Features:

- Synchronous Endpoints: Handle immediate operations (create case, update case, fetch medical history, etc.).  
- Webhooks: Trigger key notifications (new lab results, follow-up reminders).  
- Granular Permissions: Ensure secure, role-based access (doctors, nurses, admin staff, etc.).

### Employee (Staff) Interface

- Queue Management: Organize incoming patient cases for triage.  
- Customizable Views: Focus on urgent or specialized cases.  
- Real-Time Updates: Immediately reflect changes for better coordination.  
- Quick Filters: Sort cases by specialty, priority level, or location.  
- Bulk Operations: Expedite routine tasks like confirming check-ups or sending follow-up messages.

### Case Handling

- Patient History: Consolidate medical records and prior communications.  
- Rich Text Editing: Provide patient instructions, medical advice, and other written guidance.  
- Quick Responses: Implement standardized replies or medical resource links.  
- Collaboration Tools: Foster teamwork among doctors, nurses, and support staff.

### Performance Tools

- Metrics Tracking: Monitor case resolution times and patient satisfaction.  
- Template Management: Speed up common tasks with prebuilt response templates for various ailments.  
- Personal Stats: Empower staff to meet performance goals and track patient feedback.

### Administrative Control

- Team Management: Create and manage staff teams aligned with medical specialties (e.g., cardiology, pediatrics).  
- Assignment Logic: Automatically assign incoming cases to appropriate clinicians based on specialties or availability.  
- Schedule Monitoring: Track coverage based on clinic hours or on-call times.  

### Routing Intelligence

- Rule-Based Assignment: Direct cases based on metadata (patient’s condition, urgency, insurance plan).  
- Specialty-Based Routing: Ensure that cases go to the right medical professionals.  
- Load Balancing: Distribute cases fairly across shifts and time zones.

### Data Management

- Schema Flexibility: Easily integrate new data fields like insurance details, lab results, or second-opinion statuses.  
- Migration System: Keep the database structured during expansions or version updates.  
- Audit Logging: Maintain detailed logs of all changes for compliance and accountability.  
- Archival Strategies: Efficiently handle long-term storage of patient cases in compliance with healthcare regulations.

### Performance Optimization

- Caching: Reduce load for frequently accessed data ( patient FAQs, symptom checkers ).  
- Query Optimization: Improve the efficiency of patient data lookups.  
- Scalable Storage: Handle large volumes of medical records and attachments (imaging, lab reports).  
- Regular Maintenance: Prevent downtime and keep the system secure.

### Patient Features

- Patient Portal:  
  - View, update, and track their medical cases or inquiries.  
  - Review past test results, messages, and transcripts.  
  - Secure login and patient verification.

### Self-Service Tools

- Knowledge Base: Provide searchable FAQs on common medical conditions, treatment guidelines, or insurance policies.  
- AI-Powered Chatbots: Offer immediate answers to routine questions (symptom checks, medication queries).  
- Interactive Tutorials: Guide patients through tasks like filling out forms or booking appointments.

### Communication Tools

- Live Chat: Connect patients in real time with nurses or AI triage bots.  
- Email Integration: Allow patients to open and update cases directly via secure email.  
- Web Widgets: Embed medical Q&A tools or appointment requests on patient portals and hospital websites.

### Feedback and Engagement

- Follow-Up Surveys: Gather patient feedback after case resolution or treatment.  
- Ratings System: Let patients rate their experience for quality improvement.

### Multi-Channel Support

- Mobile-Friendly Design: Ensure patients can access care from mobile devices.
- Omnichannel Integration: Track interactions via portals, chat, or phone consultations.

### Advanced Features

- Proactive Alerts: Notify patients of important updates (test results, follow-ups).
