Missing Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies for Staff
• What’s Broken: The code shows that patients have RLS policies allowing them to select/insert messages in their own conversations. However, the “Staff policies” section in the SQL migration is commented out, so there is no explicit policy granting staff or other roles permission to read/write patient conversations in the database.
• Effect on Functionality: As soon as staff users were introduced, the conversation or message queries can no longer properly discriminate which users (including patients) are allowed to view or insert messages. This can block the entire conversation fetch for your regular (patient) role if the database logic fails or short-circuits for unrecognized roles.
• Proposed Resolution:
– In your Supabase migration (or the relevant RLS configuration file), add explicit policies for staff. For example, staff could SELECT/INSERT messages in conversations that they have been assigned, while still preserving patient access to their own conversation.
– Ensure that the final state is something like “patient_id = auth.uid() OR assigned_staff_id = auth.uid()” if staff is assigned, or any condition appropriate to your domain.
Inconsistent Access Checks in useChat Hook
• What’s Broken: The useChat hook tries to determine chatAccess based on userRole and assigned_staff_id (or can_create_case). If these checks fail or return the wrong canAccess property, patients might be prevented from fetching messages.
• Effect on Functionality: If the hook incorrectly sets canAccess = 'ai' (or another restricted setting) for patients when staff roles are configured, the front end either sees no data or cannot fetch messages.
• Proposed Resolution:
– Confirm that when userRole === 'patient', the fallback logic sets canAccess to 'both' for that patient’s own conversation.
– Verify the assigned_staff_id check does not inadvertently lock out the original patient.
– Log the final resolved chatAccess state in development and ensure patients get the expected “both” access.
subscribeToConversation Function Reference Without Actual Implementation
• What’s Broken: The docs mention subscribeToConversation, but the code only calls subscribeToMessages internally. If the code references subscribeToConversation anywhere for real-time logic, that function does not exist in chat-service.ts.
• Effect on Functionality: Real-time message updates (and possibly presence or typing indicators) might never initialize if the function is missing. The user interface could appear “frozen” or never display new messages.
• Proposed Resolution:
– Either remove references to subscribeToConversation (if you now use subscribeToMessages instead) or implement the missing function in chat-service.ts that properly opens a Supabase Realtime channel based on conversationId.
– Ensure the front end calls the correct subscription method so both staff and patient roles receive real-time updates.
Staff Integration Breaking Patient Access When Checking case_id
• What’s Broken: In the useChat logic, there is a path that fetches the conversation’s case_id, assigned_staff_id, etc., to confirm staff or admin roles can proceed. If that check fails or throws an error, the hook falls back to canAccess = 'ai', even for the patient.
• Effect on Functionality: Patients might see no messages or a blocked UI if the staff-based check incorrectly fails for them (for instance, a patient conversation that is missing a case_id or assigned_staff_id triggers an error, which sets restricted access).
• Proposed Resolution:
– In the “checkAccess” useEffect, if userRole === 'patient', bypass the staff-only checks and ensure patient access is preserved.
– Log these queries and checks to confirm no unexpected error is thrown for normal patient users.
Potential Race Condition with conversationId and Role Checks
• What’s Broken: The code transitions from not having a conversationId to having one, while simultaneously validating userRole-based permissions. If the conversation or the userRole load out of sync, a draft conversation might be created with partial metadata (like assigned_staff_id set incorrectly), locking out the patient.
• Effect on Functionality: Patients could see an “empty conversation” or have no permission to load messages because the assignment is incomplete.
• Proposed Resolution:
– Make sure conversation creation sets the correct can_create_case or assigned_staff_id. Do not assign staff_id or set the conversation to staff-only until the conversation is clearly handed off.
– Use loading states or guards so the hook does not prematurely evaluate a brand-new conversation when userRole or the assignment data is not yet available.
No Staff-Specific Policy in medical_messages for Insert/Select
• What’s Broken: Patients have a policy that says they can insert/select their own conversation messages. Staff roles do not. If a conversation is now “owned” (or partially owned) by staff, patients might lose read access if the condition is strictly “patient_id = auth.uid().”
• Effect on Functionality: A patient chat might appear broken because the code tries to match patient_id = auth.uid(), but the conversation is effectively assigned to staff, so the database might block queries for the patient user.
• Proposed Resolution:
– Update the policy in medical_messages to permit either the patient_id = auth.uid() OR assigned_staff_id = auth.uid() to satisfy both roles’ read/write access.
– If you have staff escalation or group assignment, make the policy robust enough so patients never lose their ability to view their own messages.
By updating the RLS policies (adding staff conditions), synchronizing the front-end role checks, and ensuring the fallback access states do not lock patients out, your chat feature should resume normal function for both staff and regular user (patient) roles.
