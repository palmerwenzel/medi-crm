# Remaining Linting Errors and Their Solutions

Below are each of the remaining linting errors from your list, along with recommended solutions. These solutions follow the hierarchy in “linting-rules.md” (Priority A → B → C) and ensure we keep the codebase clean and consistent.

---

## 1. ./src/app/api/cases/__tests__/cases.test.ts

• "NextResponse is defined but never used."  
  - Remove the unused import if not in use, for example:
    ```diff
    - import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
    ```
• "PostgrestError is defined but never used."  
  - Remove the unused import:
    ```diff
    - import type { PostgrestError } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
    ```

---

## 2. ./src/components/cases/new-case-form.tsx

• "React Hook 'useEffect' is called conditionally."  
  - Hooks must not be inside conditionals or return statements; reorder logic so all hooks run before any returns.  
  - Example fix: move the useEffect above any conditional returns.

• "'removed' is assigned a value but never used."  
  - Remove the variable assignment or use it if it’s logically needed.

---

## 3. ./src/components/cases/shared/case-management-view.tsx

• "'CaseItemSkeleton' is defined but never used."  
  - Delete the import or variable if truly unused.  
• "'viewType' is defined but never used."  
  - Remove or utilize this variable if needed for display logic.

---

## 4. ./src/components/cases/shared/file-viewer.tsx

• "'formatFileSize' is defined but never used."  
  - Remove or implement this function if you intended to format file sizes.

---

## 5. ./src/components/cases/shared/hooks/use-case-management.ts

• "'useEffect' is defined but never used."  
  - Remove the import if the effect is no longer needed, or add applicable logic.  
• "'isDashboard', 'hasMore', 'setHasMore', 'offset', 'setOffset' are assigned a value but never used."  
  - Remove if no longer necessary, or wire them in if you intend to use pagination or toggle a dashboard state.  
• "React Hook useCallback has missing dependencies: 'applyFilters' and 'currentFilters'."  
  - Include them in the dependency array, or remove the array if you don’t want memoization.  
• "'loadStaffMembers' is assigned a value but never used."  
  - Remove or implement the function if it’s supposed to load staff data.

---

## 6. ./src/components/cases/staff/case-assignment-dialog.tsx

• "'supabase' is assigned a value but never used."  
  - Remove the assignment if not required.  
• "React Hook 'useEffect' is called conditionally."  
  - Move the hook to the top level of the component.

---

## 7. ./src/components/cases/staff/internal-notes-editor.tsx

• "'CardFooter' is defined but never used."  
  - Remove if the component logic no longer requires a footer.

---

## 8. ./src/components/cases/staff/performance-metrics.tsx

• "'Progress' is defined but never used."  
  - Remove the import or component if unused.

---

## 9. ./src/components/cases/staff/priority-manager.tsx

• "'Button' is defined but never used."  
  - Remove or implement if you originally intended a button UI.

---

## 10. ./src/components/cases/staff/staff-toolbar.tsx

• "'isLoading' is assigned a value but never used."  
  - Remove or hook it into the loading state if needed.

---

## 11. ./src/components/dashboard/views/staff-dashboard.tsx

• "The 'loadStats' function makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook change on every render."  
  - Move the function definition inside useEffect, or wrap it in useCallback if it’s defined outside the effect but used as a dependency.

---

## 12. ./src/components/patients/patient-details.tsx

• "'setIsLoading' is assigned a value but never used."  
  - Remove or use it for a loading indicator if needed.  
• "' can be escaped with &apos;, &lsquo;, &#39;, &rsquo;."  
  - Properly escape the single quote for HTML, e.g. "it&#39;s" or a similar approach.

---

## 13. ./src/components/ui/date-range-picker.tsx

• "'addDays' is defined but never used."  
  - Remove or utilize if you need date manipulation.

---

## 14. ./src/components/ui/icons.tsx

• "'LucideIcon' is defined but never used."  
  - Remove or implement if the icon type was intended for something else.

---

## 15. ./src/hooks/cases/use-case-management.ts

• "'staffSpecialtyEnum' and 'StaffSpecialty' are defined but never used."  
  - Remove or incorporate them properly if your domain logic needs them.  
• "'isDashboard' is assigned a value but never used."

  - Remove if not using Next.js revalidation.  
• "'CaseHistoryResponse' is defined but never used."  
  - Use the type or remove it if you decided not to provide a typed response.

---

## 17. ./src/lib/actions/cases.ts

• "'createCaseSchema' is defined but never used."  
  - Implement in your request validation flow or remove if not needed.

---

## 18. ./src/lib/actions/files.ts

• "'sanitizeFileName' is defined but never used."  
  - Remove or incorporate if you need file name sanitization.  
• "'data' is assigned a value but never used."  
  - Remove or process the data if you intended to do something with it.

---

## 19. ./src/lib/supabase/__tests__/auth-flow.test.ts

• "'testUsers' is never reassigned. Use 'const' instead."  
  - Change from let/var to const if it is immutable.

---

## 20. ./src/lib/supabase/__tests__/rls/users.test.ts

• "'userError' is assigned a value but never used."  
  - Remove or log it if you want to see the error.

---

## 21. ./src/lib/utils/__tests__/file-validation.test.ts

• "'AllowedMimeType' is defined but never used."  
  - Remove if you aren’t validating mime types here.

---

## 22. ./src/lib/utils/__tests__/webhook.test.ts

• "'getCurrentTimestamp' is defined but never used."  
  - Either remove it or test it if you intended to confirm timestamps.

---

## 23. ./src/lib/validations/case.ts

• "'Database' is defined but never used."  
  - Remove the import or if needed for type references, actually implement it.

---

## 24. ./src/providers/auth-provider.tsx

• Multiple "'prev' is defined but never used."  
  - Remove these unused parameters in your setState or callback functions.

---

## 25. ./src/utils/supabase/api.ts

• "'cookies' is defined but never used."

---

## 26. ./src/utils/supabase/middleware.ts

  - Remove if not required, or hook it into your middleware logic.  
• "'logRedirect' is defined but never used."  
  - Same as above.

## Final Notes

1. Always follow the linting hierarchy from “linting-rules.md”:  
   • Priority A (Hooks & compile-blocking TypeScript issues) → fix first.  
   • Priority B (missing dependencies, unused vars) → next.  
   • Priority C (cosmetic or minor) → last.  

2. Verify each fix with a new lint run and confirm that all tests still pass.  

3. For repeated logic (such as role checking or fallback handling), consider extracting shared utilities to avoid code duplication.

4. Commit changes in small, logical batches to make it easier to review and rollback if needed.

By addressing each of these lint errors with clarity and aligning with the “type-system-rules.md” for type safety, you ensure a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
