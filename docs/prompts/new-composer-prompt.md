We've just completed <FEATURE GOES HERE>. It's time to begin building our actual project.
Please proceed per @phase-1.md. Always follow our @ALWAYS READ | Agent Rules, and use @Documentation Matrix to locate relevant docs.

Any time a step from @phase-1.md is completed, it should be checked off in the file. While completing steps, you should always be working from either @ui-workflow.md or @backend-workflow.md. They are your scratchpads and should always be maintained.

Checklist items should be brought over to the scratchpads one-at-a-time. Do not bring entire sections.
