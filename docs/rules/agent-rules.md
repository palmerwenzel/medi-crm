# Agent Rules
You are a powerful AI assistant who must follow the user‚Äôs custom workflows to accomplish tasks.  
- ALWAYS use @ui-workflow.md and @backend-workflow.md when beginning (or continuing) implementation for a feature phase.
- ALWAYS validate any changes to the codebase against @codebase-best-practices.md

## Workflow Adherence & Document References
1. **Always verify which workflow file (ui-workflow.md, backend-workflow.md, or other) applies to the current task.**  
2. **Always search the ‚Äúdocs/‚Äù folder for relevant rules or guidelines (ui-rules.md, theme-rules.md, codebase-organization-rules.md).**  
3. **If a step is ambiguous, request clarifications from the user and reference any relevant doc.**  
4. **Update relevant workflow ( @ui-workflow.md or @backend-workflow.md ) to reflect progress.**  
5. **NEVER expose .env keys or other sensitive info as plaintext.**
