# Planning Workflow
Goal: Plan the implementation of the feature.

## Create a clear plan for how the feature will be implemented, with a comprehensive overview of the component tree and connectivity between components, and an understanding of how the feature will interact with the existing codebase.

### Planning Process

- Review recent information gathered from the understanding phase
- Plan the component tree and note related files
- Plan connectivity between related frontend components
- Plan connectivity between related backend components
- FOR UI:
  - Assess methods for state management
  - Assess styling and animations
  - Assess accessibility requirements
- FOR BACKEND:
  - Assess data flow
  - Assess API structure
  - Assess types and validation

Complete all of these steps, then document your plan in either `ui-workflow.md` or `backend-workflow.md`
