# Understanding Workflow
Goal: Understand the task and its requirements.

## Identify relevant documentation across the codebase to gather information about relevant guidelines, existing or related components, data models, and integration points.

### Documentation Review Process

- Start by examining the project's root directory structure
- Identify relevant files in the `docs/rules/` directory that are related to the feature
- Locate related components in the component directory
- Review component documentation and TypeScript interfaces
- Identify similar existing features and their implementations
- Review database schema definitions
- Study API endpoint specifications
- Understand data flow and state management patterns

Complete all of these steps, then document your understanding in either `ui-workflow.md` or `backend-workflow.md`
