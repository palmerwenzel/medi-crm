# UI Workflow

## Project State
Phase 3 (Post-MVP Enhancements)

## Task Breakdown
- [x] Break down components and document primary feature
- [x] Implement SLA fields and validation
- [x] Create SLA indicator component
- [x] Create performance metrics display
- [x] Integrate components into case queue view
- [x] Enhance bulk operations interface
- [x] Organize and clean up components
  - [x] Move case management hook to proper location
  - [x] Consolidate bulk operation components
  - [x] Move case list item to its own directory
  - [x] Extract case formatting utilities
  - [x] Update imports to use new locations
  - [x] Fix type issues and linter errors
  - [x] Ensure proper type imports and validation
- [ ] Add specialty/tag filtering system
- [ ] Add performance metrics dashboard

## Primary Feature
**Advanced Staff Features**
- Enhanced filtering with priority, specialty, and tags
- Bulk operations for efficient case management
- Performance tracking with SLA compliance and metrics

## Components
- [x] SLA fields and validation
  - Added to case schema
  - Includes response and resolution targets
  - Tracks last update time
- [x] SLA indicator component
  - Visual status indicator
  - Tooltip with time remaining
  - Color-coded states
- [x] Performance metrics display
  - Case resolution stats
  - SLA compliance tracking
  - Average response times
- [x] Bulk operations interface
  - Status updates
  - Assignment changes
  - Confirmation dialogs
  - Loading states
  - Proper type safety
  - Keyboard accessibility

## Implementation Progress
1. [x] Added SLA configuration and metadata types
2. [x] Created SLA indicator component
3. [x] Enhanced case schema with SLA fields
4. [x] Added performance metrics component
5. [x] Integrated components into case queue view
6. [x] Organized components into proper directories
   - Moved hooks to `src/hooks/cases`
   - Consolidated bulk operations
   - Extracted utilities
   - Updated imports
   - Fixed type issues
   - Added proper validation

## Key Decisions
1. Using tiered SLA configuration based on case priority
2. Focusing on key performance indicators:
   - Resolution rate
   - SLA compliance
   - Average response time
3. Component organization:
   - Complex components in dedicated directories
   - Shared utilities in `src/lib/utils`
   - Hooks in feature-specific directories
   - Consistent import paths
4. Type system improvements:
   - Proper validation schemas
   - Type-safe props and state
   - Clear type hierarchy

## Component Organization Issues
Last Updated: [Current Date]

### 1. Completed Reorganization
- [x] Moved bulk operations to dedicated directory
- [x] Consolidated filter components
- [x] Extracted case formatting utilities
- [x] Proper type imports and validation
- [x] Fixed component dependencies

### 2. Directory Structure
Current:
```
cases/
├── shared/
│   ├── bulk-operations/
│   │   └── index.tsx
│   ├── case-list-item/
│   │   └── index.tsx
│   ├── case-management-view.tsx
│   └── filters/
│       └── components/
├── staff/
│   └── views/
│       └── case-queue-view.tsx
└── hooks/
    └── cases/
        └── use-case-management.ts
```

### 3. Next Steps
1. [ ] Implement specialty/tag filtering system
2. [ ] Add performance metrics dashboard
3. [ ] Enhance bulk operations interface
4. [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
